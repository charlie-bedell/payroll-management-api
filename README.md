## TODOS
TODO user roles (employee, manager, admin) work as expected so far
TODO add bearer token to front end
TODO after frontend: add routes for admin page/manager so they can update employees
TODO after frontend: employees should be redirected to their own employee page when they
     try to access a resource they are not allowed to (low priority)
TODO routes for departments
TODO bulk edit for admins and managers (stretch goal)
